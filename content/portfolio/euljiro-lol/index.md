I made an interactive website/artwork with powerful threejs library. The general concept, 3D models, and gamification elements are inspired by my experience at Euljiro district in Seoul, South Korea.

This is a part of ongoing exhibition 'Folding of the City' at Eulji Art Center, inspired by Jingfang Hao's SF novel "Folding Beijing".
