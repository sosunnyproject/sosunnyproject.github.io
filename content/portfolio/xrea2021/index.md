<h3>
A site-specific XR artwork about reinterpreting the meanings of ‘monster’ in a techno-advanced 21st century.
</h3>

<br />

The team name, X-REA means 'let's create x-dimensional experience in the area'.

In 1818, Mary Shelley wrote the original SF classic, Frankenstein. X-REA started this project by following her life stories. Questioning 'Why did she create a monster?' we connected the imaginary creatures with the real-world exhibition space. We also designed a new ‘monster’ reflecting the modern society and technologies. 

We shared each other’s analysis and point of view of the symbolism of a ‘monster’ in our modern society, took apart our individual rules, and reconstructed them into a XR-formatted content. The 4 X-REA artists behind the one who created the year 2021 modern-day ‘monster’ is the Mary Shelley of this day. 

<h3>Details about Storytelling</h3>

In the 1800s, Dr. Frankenstein’s monster was a supernatural creature with a mixture of individual and social desires to surpass God. Monsters were not human but imperfect existences that pretended to be human and adjust to the world. We analyzed various phenomena in society and the causes of anxiety in individuals during the process of finding out the appearance of a modern-day monster. After many conversations, we defined “a 21st century monster as a being who tries to overcome human limitations with technology.”

The results from human desires have been manifested by technology -- technology that violates human territory, and technology that tries to force human limitations intentionally or unintentionally provide convenience but also stimulate anxiety and various emotions. Each individual may feel threatened and find it future-oriented.

Modern people are in a position of simultaneously enjoying and consuming such developed skills. This is why we believe we have the responsibility of considering the various forms created by technology and its societal and ethical perspectives, and imperfect fantasies.

We have expressed a modern monster created by that technology as an XR artwork. The modern monster was inspired by social media, AI robots, energy drinks that defy a human’s body clock etc,. In addition, in the last scene, the modern monster created by that technology depicts them on the same page of humans(viewers) as intelligent independent creatures that are no longer interpreted as a methodology or medium. 

The monster is modern Frankenstein made with technology and human spirit yet a digital hard hydra, embodying Cocoons as a new being rapidly trying to transcend human limitations and human inherent domains. We hope the audience will take a moment to step back from the reckless or unconscious consumption of technology and experience the artwork from their own perspective and think about the 21st century Frankenstein as a modern being.

X-REA: 공간(area)을 XR, X차원의 경험이 있는 공간을 만들자

메리셸리는 프랑켄슈타인 소설을 쓴 여성 작가입니다. 
우리는 메리셸리의 생애를 추적하며 ‘왜 그녀는 괴물을 창조했을까?’ 하는 물음을 갖게 되었습니다.  

그러면서 우리는 현대 사회에서의 ‘괴물'의 상징성에 대해 서로의 해석과 관점을 나누고, 각자 갖고 있던 장르적 문법을 해체하고 재조립했습니다. 그렇게 2021년 현대판 ‘괴물'을 
창조한 X-REA 4명의 작가는 이 시대의 메리셸리입니다.
